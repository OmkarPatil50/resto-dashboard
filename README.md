## Overview

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- CSS
- D3.js

## Features

### 1. Song Request Configuration:

- **Charge Customers:** The value (true or false) is fetched from the "charge_customers" key in the API response. If set to "Yes," the following fields become editable; otherwise, they are greyed out.
  
- **Custom Song Request Amount:** The integer value is fetched from "category_6" in the response. It is a mandatory field if song requests are chargeable, with a minimum value of 99. The "Save" button is enabled only if the entered value is higher than 99; otherwise, it is greyed out.

- **Regular Song Request Amounts:** Values are fetched in descending order from "category_7," "category_8," "category_9," and "category_10" in the response. They are mandatory if song requests are chargeable, with minimum values of 79, 59, 39, and 19, respectively. The "Save" button is enabled only if all entered values are higher than the specified minimum values; otherwise, it is greyed out.

### 2. Graph:

- A dynamic bar chart that changes based on the values entered for custom and regular song request amounts. If song requests are not chargeable, the graph is removed.
